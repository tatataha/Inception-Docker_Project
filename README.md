# Inception

As part of a system administration project, I created entirely original Docker images for MariaDB, Nginx and WordPress, and established their interconnections to operate within a virtual machine.

## Usage

Clone project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tatataha/Inception-Docker_Project.git
```

Go to project folder

```bash
  cd inception
```

Run Makefile

```bash
  make
```

  
## Note

Some parameters such as configurations, file paths, and user information may lead to compatibility issues. If you wish to try the project, you should replace the necessary parts with your own information
